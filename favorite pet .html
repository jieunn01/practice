	<h1> This is my pet as a roommate! </h1>
	<h2> For me, I cannot describe myself without describe my dog. I will introduce my pet named "pori". 
	<p> He is 9 years old man, he became our family member when he was born around 2 months after. He love people and get attention. He never bite someone and meek as a lamb. He likes to walk around so I am willing to walk together, Honestly, he went out three times over everyday.It could be a short time to long time, Even though, he is getting old, I've never seen he looks tired when he walk around. I really wish him both health and longevity!   </p><br>
	<h3>As you can see, he love sitting on the soft ground especially new washing blanket. </h3><br>
